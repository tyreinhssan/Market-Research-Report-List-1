<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insulin API Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Regular Human Insulin</li><li>Insulin Analogue</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Insulin API market is divided into two main categories: Regular Human Insulin and Insulin Analogs. Regular Human Insulin, derived from recombinant DNA technology, has a predictable action profile and is typically used to manage blood glucose levels in diabetes. Insulin Analogs, on the other hand, are genetically modified insulins designed to have altered absorption rates, offering more flexible dosing and improved glycemic control. Both types serve essential roles in diabetes management, catering to varying patient needs.</p></p>
