<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Escape Respirators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Purifying Escape Respirator</li><li>Self Contained Escape Respirator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The escape respirators market primarily includes two types: Air Purifying Escape Respirators (APERs) and Self-Contained Escape Respirators (SCERs). APERs filter out contaminants from the air, providing protection in environments with low levels of hazardous materials. They are lightweight and suitable for short-term escape scenarios. In contrast, SCERs supply breathable air from a contained source, offering greater protection in more hazardous environments, where contaminated air poses a serious risk. Both types are essential for worker safety in emergencies.</p></p>
